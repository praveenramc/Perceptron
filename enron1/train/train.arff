subject by the federal communications commission ( fcc ) in washington ,\r\ndc . their petition , number 2493 , would ultimately pave the way to stop the\r\nreading of the gospel our lord and savior , and the airwaves of america .\r\nthey got 287 , 000 signatures to back their stand ! if this attempt is\r\nsuccessful , all sunday worship services being broadcast on the radio or by\r\ntelevision will be stopped . this group is also campaigning to remove all\r\nchristmas programs and christmas carols from public schools ! ! you as a\r\nchristian can help !\r\nwe are praying for at least 1 million signatures . this would defeat their\r\neffort and how that there are many christians alive , well and concerned\r\nabout our country . as christians we must unite on this .\r\nplease don \' t take this lightly . we ignored this lady once and lost prayer in\r\nour school and in offices across the nation .\r\nplease stand up for your religious freedom and let your voice be heard .\r\ntogether we\r\ncan make a difference in our country while creating an opportunity\r\nfor the lost to know the lord .\r\nplease press \" forward \" , clean up the message , and forward this to
